This project has the code for my practice/bullpen/outing comparison graphics. 
It will produce two graphics, one based on movement and one based on release, to visualize differences in the pitcher's pitches between times throwing. This can be done between seasons, between starts, or between bullpens when there is a clear targeted goal.

I'm still working on the angular plots, I'm not confident about the movement as of now, so the lines may become more curved based on my digging. 

Inspiration is linked in the notebook, and criticism/questions are always welcome!
