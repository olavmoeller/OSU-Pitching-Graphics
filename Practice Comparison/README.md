This project has the code for my practice/bullpen/outing comparison graphics. 
It will produce two graphics, one based on movement and one based on release, to visualize differences in the pitcher's pitches between times throwing. This can be done between seasons, between starts, or between bullpens when there is a clear targeted goal.

I'm still working on the angular plots, I'm not confident about the movement as of now, so the lines may become more curved based on my digging. 

Inspiration is linked in the notebook, and criticism/questions are always welcome!

The ipynb notebook will likely stay unchanged, as a relic of my methodology and beginnings. I am working on redesigns, which will be updated in the (forthcoming) py files in the app section, which will get pushed to my Huggingface app. Additionally, it is easier to make small changes just to the relevant py file, as I use that to get output, rather than make sure the ipynb and py files are all at the same point, etc.
